Attack Time!
Here I (your fearless leader) will walk you through the attack steps. For this part of the final we are doing Cross Site Scripting (aka XSS) because its almost XMAS (haha get it?)

What the heck is Cross Site Scripting?
Well it is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to compromise interactible content on a web site such as file uploads, text boxes, etc.

Step 1: Boot up your Docker contaiter and head to http://localhost:3000
See Run_Docker_Cont in Images_OWSAP

Step 2: Head to the Login In page in the top right corner and then make a new account by clicking the new user buttin at the bottom.
See User_Register.png in Images_OWSAP

Step 3: Add something to your cart and then go to your cart and check out. Go through all the screens and enter random information until you reach this screen:
See Order_sumary.png in Images_OWSAP

Step 4: After the order confirmed screen go to the the top right corner and click on Account -> Orders and Payment -> Order History. You should come to this screen:
See Order_history.png in Images_OWSAP

Step 5: Click on the little image of the truck in the order information (when you hover over it it should show "Track Order") and it should bring you to this screen:
See OG_searchresults.png in Images_OWSAP

Step 6: In the url bar replace the current url with this: http://localhost:3000/#/track-result?id=IcanputanythingIwanthere Then reload the page, it should display IcanputanythingIwanthere in the search results as seen here: 
See edited_searchresults.png in Images_OWSAP

!!!!!BONUS!!!!!

Cross Site Scripting can also be used in another place! 

If you go to the search bar up in the top right and type in (or copy paste if we are being realistic) this:

<iframe src="javascript:alert('Get Got!')">

You should get a popup that says "get got!"
